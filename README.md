# Full-Stack-Cloud-Practice
Full-stack deployment practice on AWS EC2. Includes Linux server configuration via SSH and Bash automation scripts.

## Overview
This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with **Infrastructure and Cloud**. I deployed a Python Flask application onto an **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** instance to practice production-level environment management.

## Cloud & Unix Skills Demonstrated
* **Remote Management:** Configured and managed the server via **SSH**.
* **Linux Administration:** Performed system updates, dependency installations, and process management.
* **Bash Scripting:** Created a `deploy.sh` script to automate the server setup process.

## Tech Stack
* **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, Security Groups)
* **OS:** Ubuntu (Linux)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
